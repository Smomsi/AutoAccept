# AutoAccept
AutoAccept is a Python script that enables players of the popular online game "League of Legends" to streamline their experience by automating the process of accepting the game's queue. This script accomplishes its task by mimicking the actions of a player and simulating a user click on the "accept" button when a match is found.
