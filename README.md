# AutoAccept
AutoAccept is a Python script that enables players of the popular online game "League of Legends" to streamline their experience by automating the process of accepting the game's queue. This script accomplishes its task by mimicking the actions of a player and simulating a user click on the "accept" button when a match is found.

In the event that your game is set to a language other than English, it may be necessary to capture a new screenshot of the "Accept" button and place it in the same folder as the Python script (while keeping the same file name). This will ensure that the script can properly recognize the button and continue to function correctly.
